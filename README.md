# Using Nutshell

To start out, you will need to make a new user profile. To do this, navigate to the login option in the navbar and click on it. You will be presented with a form entitled Log In, in which you will find a button called Add New User. When this button is clicked, you will be presented with the Add New User Form. After creating a new user, you will be able to navigate to the different sections of the website and create, edit, and delete new content in each section of the page.

# Nutshell Features

- Tasks: keep track of important tasks and when you expect to complete them. Once the task is finished, simply click the "completed" completed checkbox and it will disappear from the screen, but not from your database!
- News: build a library of news articles for later viewing. Save interesting stories, edit your thoughts about them, and delete them when they are done.
- Events: it can be so hard to keep track of everything happening around you. So here is a great place to store information about events in which you are interested! Add new events you'd like to attend, edit the date if details change, delete when the event is over.
- Messages: a message board to share with the Nutshell Community. Post a new message to the group, and edit if you think of a better message to send. No delete option though, so be careful!
